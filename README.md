# Environmental-Impact-Assessment

## Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model to estimate environmental impact scores based on various environmental parameters. The dataset contains synthetic data representing daily measurements of temperature, humidity, wind speed, air quality index (AQI), and a calculated impact score for the year 2023. The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and feature importance analysis.
